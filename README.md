# Mongoose Database Again

# Purpose
I created this database as a way to maintain my coding skills with MongooseDB. This database resembles a blog
where users can post articles and have other users resopnd to their posts. I was able to check the information
this database contains by using the insomnia software as I built gthe database. I encourage anybody who wants 
to become more familiar with mongoose to watch the demonstration vdieo.

# Tasks
- As a user I can post articles that I find interesting on a blog
- As a user I can react and comment to articles already posted by other users
- Create a reply section that allows users to interact with one another
- AS a user my posts can be deleted if necessary
- Allow comments to a blog post to be deleted if necessary

# Tasks Achieved By
I was able to achieve the tasks listed above by looking at the mongoose database I created while attending the coding bootcamp
at Utah University. It helped me to refresh my memory on how to use mongoose to create a functioning database and provided pointers 
if I ever got stuck. The other resource I used was reviewing the lesson material on mongoose databases provided to me by the 
University of Utah.

# Downloading Database
If a person wants to download this database onto thier own computer they need to make sure they have the right
software downloaded onto thier computer. The software he or she needs to download is called visual studio code. 
Make sure you download the one based on the type of you computer.

After downloading visual studio code a person needs to download the source code from my 
github repostiory. The link to my respository is listed below.
