# Mongoose Database Again

# Purpose
To demonstrate how a mongoose database works and how information can be retireved from the database. The demonstration
for this databse can be found at the bottom of this file. I encourage anybody who wants to become more familiar with 
mongoose to watch the demonstration vdieo.

# Tasks
- Enable a user to post articles that he or she finds interesting on a blog
- Enable a user to react and comment to articles already posted by other users
- Create a reply section that allows users to interact with one another
- Enable a user to be deleted from the database when necessary
- Allow comments to a blog post to be deleted if necessary

# Tasks Achieved By
I was able to achieve the tasks listed above by looking at the mongoose database I created while attending the coding bootcamp
at Utah University. It helped me to refresh my memory on how to use mongoose to create a functioning database and provided pointers 
if I ever got stuck. The other resource I used was reviewing the lesson material on mongoose databases provided to me by the 
University of Utah.
